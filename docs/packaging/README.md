# Packaging

Thereâ€™s millions of open source projects and `tea` needs your help to package
them up!

# Packagers Who Care

You trust us to just work and make your workflows happen.
We take this job seriously and we go the extra mile on a per-package basis,
eg. our `git` ignores `.DS_Store` files by default, and our RubyGems defaults to
user-installs and ensures gems are in `PATH`. Also we insist our packages
are relocatable, which is why we can install in your home directory (but this
also means you could pick up the whole `~/.tea` directory and bundle it with
your app.) We also begin packaging new releases almost immediately as soon as
they go live using various automations.
